Okay, so the idea here is I want to make a banking application to practice
some of the concepts I learned in cs18

This banking application is going to need a customer class, a bank account class,
and a class for the banking system itself. 

Start slow. Do a little everyday. This is only meant as a fun exercise to
supplement my learning. This is not meant as a stressor.
