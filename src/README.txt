Hi there,

This is a personal project based on one of the examples dicussed my Computer Science course. 
I want to challenge myself to further internalize the concepts learned in class by continuing to build
on them. This project focuses a lot on the visibility and mutablility of data, which has interested me
greatly as I've progressed through my studies.

At the end of the project, the user should be able to interact with the banking system fully: creating, manging, and deleting an account.
There should be clear security features in place both externally and internally.

This is still a work in progress, but feel free to take a look!
